Here is a collection of ideas and tasks for future releases.

* Add support for changing frequencies and governors. This can be done
  using polkit and requires redesigning and rewriting UI code. Better
  than changing frequencies nowadays would be to allow setting certain
  governor parameters.

* Add support for upower events (AC <-> battery). Maybe make it
  possible to define profiles for different power states.
